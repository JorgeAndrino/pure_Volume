# Pure Volume

Group Assignment to rebrand the PureVolume.com site.

- Project Manager: Shannon Stoltz-Limin

- Video and Logo designer: Hassan Yousef

- Full Stack Developer: John Robertson

- Designer(s): Jorge Andrino Vd B & Claudia Paguaga

Our Goal is to rebrand the PureVolume.com site. Starting with creating a proper home page, completely organizing the articles into individual categories, making it easier for visitors to find the articles or links they may be looking for. It is also to optimize the site for maximum functionality in both mobile and desktop versions; which allows better user experience.

Shannon wrote one article, while taking the rest directly from the previous site.

Jorge, Hassan, John and Claudia worked closely together to design the wireframe barebones, filling in the wireframe and on the logo design ideas; all while confirming that everyone was on board with how it looked, making necessary changes if there was a disagreement.

Each member of the group worked collaboratively to agree on the final few logo designs and the animation inspiration for the video.
