# Pure Volume

Rebranding of PureVolume.com

Our Goal was to do a complete rebrand the PureVolume.com site. Starting with creating a proper home page, organizing the articles into individual categories, making it easier for visitors to find the articles or links they may be looking for. It is also to optimize the site for maximum functionality in both mobile and desktop versions; which allows better user experience.

The promotional video can be updated weekly to advertise the newest articles, allowing visitors a quick glance at the current entertainment, pop culture and music news. This video can be easily adjusted with just changing the titles and pictures each week.

The new logo is simplistic, while providing plenty of opportunities for branding on clothing, hats business cards, pins, etc.
