This project is to build a brand for the PureVolume.com site. Starting with creating a proper home page, and completely organizing the articles into individual categories, making it easier for visitors to find the articles or links they may be looking for. It is also to optimize the site for maximum functionality in both mobile and desktop versions; which allows better user experience.

John and Shannon wrote one article each, while taking the rest directly from the previous site.

Jorge, Hassan and Claudia worked closely together to design the wireframe barebones, filling in the wireframe and on the logo design ideas; all while confirming that everyone was on board with how it looked, making necessary changes if there was a disagreement.

Each member of the group worked collaboratively to agree on the final few logo designs and the animation inspiration for the video.

In the end our goal was to create a simplistic, functional, two-page spread that can be updated at later dates as the content changes and lends itself to a good user experience.
